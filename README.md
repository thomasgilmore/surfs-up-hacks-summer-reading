# Surfs Up Hacks - Summer Reading

This is my Surfs Up Hacks Project. I'm using [NYTimes](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview) Book API to get the NYTimes Best Sellers Lists to show a Summer Reading List on a Website.  

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for this project and created a node.js server to host the project and fetch the api.

## Build/Deploy Instructions

The following commands are to build and deploy the project on a local server after you download or clone the project.

### `npm run build`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
